Well maybe, Spider-man would've survived the snap if he heard something that would make him feel better!

**Pick(me)up Lines** is a simple application that shows you a feel-good line to pick you up when you're feeling down!

Our Pick(me)up lines are picked from our community-curated database of feel-good lines. 
- *Found a line somewhere out there that you think would help someone feel good?* Submit it to our database!
- *Stumbled upon a bad line from some internet troll?* Get it out of our database!
- *Saw a typo in one of the lines?* Fix that typo!
- *Line was first said by a certain someone?* Acknowledge that person instead of leaving it as 'Unknown' and verify it!

Pick(me)up Lines is a simple web app with an Express backend (using a RESTful API) and a React frontend, written in TypeScript.
